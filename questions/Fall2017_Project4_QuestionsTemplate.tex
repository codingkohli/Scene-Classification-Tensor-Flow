\section*{Questions}

\paragraph{Q1:} In training a neural network classifier, what are the effects of subtracting the mean of each input image from the input image? What are the effects of subtracting the mean of our dataset from our input images?

\paragraph{Q2a:} Consider input to a convolutional neural network layer of 96 x 96 x 3. For a single kernel of size 5 x 5 x 3 and a stride of 1, followed by a 4 x 4 max pooling layer, what will the output feature map size be?

\paragraph{A2a:} Multiple choice. Use `\textbackslash{}bullet' $\bullet$ to fill in the circles in \LaTeX.

\begin{tabular}[h]{rr}
\toprule
5 x 5     & $\circ$ \\  % Replace $\circ$ with $\bullet$
22 x 22 & $\circ$ \\
23 x 23 & $\circ$ \\
24 x 24 & $\circ$ \\
25 x 25 & $\circ$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Q2b:} For the same input (96 x 96 x 3), let the convolution layer have a kernel of size 3 x 3 x 3 and a stride of 3, followed by an 8 x 8 max pooling layer. What will the output feature map size be? 

\paragraph{A2b:} Multiple choice.

\begin{tabular}[h]{rr}
\toprule
2 x 2 & $\circ$ \\
3 x 3 & $\circ$ \\
4 x 4 & $\circ$ \\
5 x 5 & $\circ$ \\
12 x 12 & $\circ$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Q2c:} Given input to a convolutional layer with stride 2x2 and kernel size 3x3, and ignoring the boundary, what is the minimum number of convolutional filters required to preserve all input information in the output feature map?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A2c:} Multiple choice.

\begin{tabular}[h]{lc}

0.5 & $\circ$ \\
1 & $\circ$ \\
2 & $\circ$ \\
4 & $\circ$ \\
It's impossible & $\circ$ \\

\paragraph{Q5:} Many CNNs have a fully connected multi-layer perceptron (MLP) after the convolutional layers as a general purpose decision-making subnetwork. What effects would a locally-connected MLP have on computer vision applications? Please give your answer in terms of the learned convolution feature maps, their connections, and the perceptrons in the MLP.
